# Automation-tool-in-Python

Before created this tool, user had to allocate data to specific person manually and it contains up to 8000 rows in excel file.
It was very wasting time and effort to do it by manually and user would have to do more productive things.

# Step 
1. Read the default files (people's info file, language file)
2. Read input file (users)
3. Allocate email address into desiered column based on native language
4. Allocate email address into desiered column based on second language
.... etc 

## Concept
- To allocate data into specific person automatically.
